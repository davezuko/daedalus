Functional JavaScript
===

There are quite a few awesome functional JavaScript libraries out there (ramda and lodash to name a few), but in wanting to better understand functional programming I made it a goal to more thoroughly understand the utilities those libraries provide.

As a result, this library will be significantly smaller in size and scope, but will hopefully be useful in creating a clean API for common functional concepts. Similarly, this means the library does not aim to support legacy browsers or fulfill all edge-cases.

Setup
===

The library currently isn't componentized (and probably will never be due to its size), so the build process is only really used to compile a minified version and run lint/test tasks.

Run a complete build (lints, tests, and compiles/transpiles)

```
gulp
```

Usage
===
... todo ...

Notes
=====
JSHint currently throws error for the primary module IIFE. These can be ignored.

TODO
===
* [ ] Deploy process (need to start forcing lints)
* [ ] Improve code organization
* [ ] Improve test organization
* [ ] Documentation
