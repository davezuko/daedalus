Functional JavaScript
===

There are quite a few awesome functional JavaScript libraries out there (ramda and lodash to name a couple), but as an aspiring functional programmer I wanted to make sure I understood the inner workings of the helpers those libraries provide. As a result, this library will be significantly smaller in size and scope, but will hopefully be useful in creating a clean API for simple functional concepts.
